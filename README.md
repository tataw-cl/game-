# The Flying Cube Game! üü•üí®

Hi!

This project is intended to help introduce you to Open Source as part of [MLH 2023 Global Hack Week: GAMES](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/9153-global-hack-week-game-week)! It's a JavaScript-based 3D game built with [Babylon.JS](https://github.com/BabylonJS) that lets you fly a Cube through a set of obstacles.

When you create a repository from this template, a series of [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) will be generated that you can pick up to get started.

The entire project can be run by opening [`game/index.html`](game/index.html) in a browser. All of the 3rd party dependencies like Babylon are using a CDN so you do not need Node or a local developer environment.

If you're new to GitHub you can get started by creating a new repository by clicking `Use this template` and then selecting `Create a new repository` to create a copy of this repository into your own GitHub account. This is where you can make your own changes!

If you want to keep learning about GitHub you can check out [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/).

If you're new to Babylon JS that's fine too! Here are some helpful links to help you get started. Babylon runs in your browser and this game should work on your Phone, Tablet or PC - you can make and test your changes from any of those devices! If something doesn't work you can enter the developer mode of your browser (F12 on Edge or Chrome) and explore the errors in the console. This developer mode also lets you insert breakpoints if you want to debug further.

-   The [Babylon.JS Playground](https://playground.babylonjs.com/) will let you explore different community samples to learn how Babylon works!
-   The [Babylon.JS API](https://doc.babylonjs.com/typedoc/modules/BABYLON) has documentation that can help you understand the API.

We've also provided a file that should support launching from VS Code that will allow you to integrate your debugging experience there as well as a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container) you can use to develop in if you choose with some recommended extensions pre-installed.

This project is intended as a sandbox for you to learn about GitHub and contributing to Open Source.

# Running the Project Locally

Follow these steps to run this project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

-   Make sure you have a modern web browser installed (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
-   Make sure you have a local server installed (e.g., [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for Visual Studio Code).

## Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. If you're using Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension, right-click on the `index.html` file and select `Open with Live Server`.
4. The project should now be running in your default web browser. If not, open your web browser and navigate to `localhost:5500` (or the port number specified by your local server).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the project, check the JavaScript console in your web browser for any error messages. These messages can provide clues about what's going wrong.
