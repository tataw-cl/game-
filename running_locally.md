# Running the Project Locally

Follow these steps to run this project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

-   Make sure you have a modern web browser installed (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
-   Make sure you have a local server installed (e.g., [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for Visual Studio Code).

## Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. If you're using Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension, right-click on the `index.html` file and select `Open with Live Server`.
4. The project should now be running in your default web browser. If not, open your web browser and navigate to `localhost:5500` (or the port number specified by your local server).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the project, check the JavaScript console in your web browser for any error messages. These messages can provide clues about what's going wrong.
